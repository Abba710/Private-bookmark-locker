        🔐 How to use Private Bookmark Locker
      </h2>

      <p>
        1. <strong>Open a page</strong> — Whether you're browsing normally or in
        incognito mode, just open the site you want to save.
      </p>

      <p>
        2. <strong>Click 💾</strong> — One click saves the page. If you're in
        incognito mode, it's saved as private.
      </p>

      <p>
        3. <strong>View your bookmarks inside the extension</strong> — All your
        saved links appear here. Use the 👁 and 🕵️‍♂️ to toggle between regular and
        private bookmarks.
      </p>

      <p>
        4. <strong>👑 Premium features</strong> — Some features are exclusive.
        You'll see which ones are premium (hint: they have a crown).
      </p>

      <p>
        5. <strong>Manage account ⌄</strong> — Click your profile at the top to
        upgrade your plan or switch accounts.
      </p>
